## Neighborhood Map project
### Best Coffee Shops in Dallas
#### Project Overview
In this project, I developed a single page application featuring a map of 12 high rated coffee shops in Dallas Neighborhood.

Technology Used: HTML, CSS, bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, knockoutJS, Google Maps API, Yelp API, and Gulp.
